These are the settings that have made us successful:
Thresholding:

Hue range as small as possible so you can find the retro reflective green
Getting rid of the lower end for saturation
Value range at the upper end
Ensure Erosion Steps and Dilation Steps are at 1 respectively. Our understanding is that these both get rid of noise
Contour Filtering:

Target Grouping - Dual target. Since there are two pieces of tape
Intersection Filter - Vert - Above. If the edges of the tape were extended infinitely they would intersect vertically and at the top (rather than vertically at the bottom)
You can find our pipeline settings in our github. It got us through two competitions.
